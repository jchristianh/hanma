# Formatting & Meta

This page demonstrates how Hanma handles front matter metadata.

### Manual Sorting
The `sort_index: 10` in this page's front matter ensures it appears *after* the Home and About pages in the navigation bar (which have default lower indexes).

### Metadata
This page specifies an `author` and a `date`. Depending on your theme, these might appear in the page footer or as meta tags in the HTML head.

### Dates
The date for this page was set to `{today}` when the scaffold was created.
